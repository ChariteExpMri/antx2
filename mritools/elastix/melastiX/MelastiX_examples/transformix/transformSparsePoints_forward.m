function transformSparsePoints_forward

% Transform points on the original image to the warped domain. 
% The transform parameters used here were those calculated to get an image deformed
% by the transform in distortLena.m back to its original state. However, as described
% in the Elastix PDF manual, these parameters define the transform *from the fixed 
% (non-deformed) image to the moving (deformed) image*. Consequently, here we transform
% points laid over the original image onto the deformed image.
