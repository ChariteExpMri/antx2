Small-World-Ness
============================

MATLAB code for computing small-world-ness

Includes functions for: <br>
computing small-world-ness from data networks <br>
statistically testing the data network divergence from an E-R random graph

See Computing_And_Testing_S_On_Data_Network.m for examples of all analyses on a test network

  This paper introduced the small-world-ness measure
* Humphries, M. D. & Gurney, K. (2008) Network 'small-world-ness': A quantitative method for determining canonical network equivalence _PLoS One_, 3, e0002051

  This paper analysed the behaviour of the small-world-ness measure, and explored its insights for a range of real-world networks
