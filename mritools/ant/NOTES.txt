IMORTANT NOTES
================
- the structural t2w nifti volume has to be renamed to "t2.nii" to use it as moving image for registration with the Allen template
- remove '.' from all mousepaths   use mouse1_1_12_82 instead of mouse1_1.12.82
- check voxelsize of original files, sometimes voxelsize is set to 1 x 1 x 1 mm presumably due during   conversion--> (see: rchangehdr.m)


================
useful files, update
================
rchangehdr.m -   change header information of 3d/4d nifti files (multifile-based)
movefilem.m  -   mass-renaming files 
copyfilem.m  -   mass-copying files  
deletem.m    -   mass-deleting files
